This prevents accidental modification of variables from the outside scope due to naming collisions.\n",

    "Defining block parameters with the same name as a local variable from the surrounding scope is considered an antipattern and may be a sign of an accidental programming error.

    "This question illustrates two different ways of indexing a sub-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to use two integers, i.e. `x[1,3]`-- This means \"get a subarray of length `3` starting at index `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use a range, which generates a subarray based the index values within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple form of using a range is something like `x[1..3]` which would give you a subarray starting at index `1` and ending at index `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Ruby also allows _negative_ indexing, which define indexes relative to the end of an array rather than the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, `x[-4..-2]` is referring to the subarray starting from the 4th to the last position in the array, and continuing to the second-to-last position.\n",

    "But because the `begin...end` expression has an `ensure` section, it is run before the interpreter exits.\n",
